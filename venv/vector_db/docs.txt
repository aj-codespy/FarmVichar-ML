Soil Science
Introduction:
•
•
•
•
•
•

The term soil is derived from Latin word “Solum” means ‘Floor’ or ‘Ground’.
Soil is the interphase between atmosphere and the mantle of rocks making up the earth’s
crust called “lithosphere”.
Regolith: All loose material above bedrock (the unconsolidated material of weathered rock
and soil material).
Soil Survey: Systematic examination, description and classification of soils.
Pedology: Science dealing with genesis, survey, classification and laws of geographic
distribution of soils as a body in nature.
Edaphology: It is the study of soils from stand point of higher plants.

Rocks:
•
•
•

•

“Rocks” are defined as the aggregates of one (or) more minerals.
Eg: Limestone – aggregation of calcite mineral.
Rocks have no definite chemical, morphological composition or definite symmetrical form
like minerals.
Based on origin, rocks are classified as
1. Igneous rocks
2. Sedimentory rocks
3. Metamorphic rocks.
I. Igneous rocks:
These are the most abundant and makeup 95% of all the earth crust.
Igneous rocks are “oldest rocks” and are also known as “crystalline (or) massive (or) fire
rocks.
These rocks mainly consist of primary minerals and more than half of the igneous rock
is containing “feldspar” minerals.
Igneous rocks based on their mode of formation are divided into two groups.
a. Extrusive (or) volcanic rocks: These are formed at the surface from the volcanic
magma. Eg: Basalt, diorite
b. Intrusive (or) plutonic rocks: These are formed by the cooling of the original magma
and occur below the earth crust. Eg: Granite.
Igneous rocks are also classified based on their chemical composition.
a. Acid rocks – contain more than 65% silica – Granite.
b. Neutral rocks – contain 50% - 65% silica – Diorite.
c. Basic rocks – contain less than 50% silica – Basalt.
II. Sedimentary rocks: These rocks are formed through the transportation and deposition of
weathered sedimens. The sedimetary rocks are mostly formed through the agency of
water, which are called clastic, aqueous or stratified rocks. Based on origin, sedimentary
rocks are classfied into 4 groups.

1. Residual sediments: These are formed from the products of weathering in situe that is at
same place. Eg: Laterite, bauxite.
2. Mechanical sediments: These are formed due to the deposition of pebbles, sand and silt. Eg:
Standstone, shale.

3. Chemical sediments: These are formed due to evaporation of water, precipitation and
consequent accumulation of sediments.
Eg: Limestone.
4. Organic sediments: These are fomred due to partial decompostion of organic remains under
anaerobic conditions.
Eg: Peat
III. Metamorphic rocks: These are formed from the rocks by the action of heat and pressure
on pre-existing igneous and / or sedimentary rocks.
Eg: Sandstone – Quartzite, Shale – Slate, Limestone – Marble, Granite – Gnesiss, Basalt – Schist,
Coal – Graphite.
Minerals: A mineral is a naturally occuring, homogenous element or inorganic compound that has
a definite chemical composition and a characteristic geometric form. The minerals can be identified
by many of their physical properties like colour, lustre, streak, hardness etc.
•
•
•

Lustre – general appearance of mineral in reflected light.
Fracture – property of the mineral to break along an irregular surface i.e., surface produced
when the mineral breaks in direction other than cleavage plane.
Streak – The colour of the powder of the mineral that is obtained by rubbing the mineral
against the unglazed porcelain plate.

Soil forming minerals mainly belong to the group of alumino – silicates. Minerals are classified
based on quantity (essential and accessory), origin (primary and secondary), specific gravity
( light and heavy) and chemical composition (native elements, oxides, sulphates, sulphides,
carbonates, halides, silicates).
Primary minerals –They are the original components of the rock, which have not been
altered chemically. They are formed from crystallization of magma (molten mass).
Eg: Quartz, feldspar etc.
Secondary minerals –are resulted from the decomposition and / or alteration of primary
minerals. These are formed due to subsequent changes in the rocks.
Eg: All clay minerals like kaolinite, illite except micas. Micas are primary minerals.
Minerals which form the chief constituent of rock and regraded as the characteristic
components of the rock are known as “Essential Minerals”. Eg: Quartz and feldspars.
Accessory minerals : The minerals which occur in small quantity in rocks They are not
concerned for naming or the nomenclature of the rocks. Such minerals are called as
“accessory minerals”. Eg: Apatite, pyrite, magnetite etc. These are not required for the
fomration of any rock.
Primary silicate minerals:
•
•

Quartz – SiO2.
Potash feldspar (Orthoclase) – KAlSi3O8, Soda feldspars (Albite) – NaAlSi3O8.

•

Lime feldspar (Anorthite) – CaAl2Si2O8; Albite and anorthite combine to form plagioclase
or soda lime feldspars.
• Feldspars are easily attacked by “water containing H2CO3”. The weathering process is
called as carbonation.
• Plagioclase weathers more rapidly than orthoclase.
Orthoclas is commonly occurring feldspar mineral in acid igneous rocks.
• Micas are the double silicates of K and Al with or without iron. These are plate like
structures.
1. Muscovite (white mica) – KAl3Si3O10(OH)2
2. Biotite (black mica) – occurs both in acidic and basic rocks.
3. Phlogopite – Occurs as a primary mineral in igneous rocks.
Biotite is easily weatherable than muscovite.
• Pyroxenes and amphiboles: These are the double silicates of Fe, Mg, Al and Ca.
• Pyroxene – Augite (dark green)
• Amphibole – Hornblende (green - black)
• Olivines are the “thin silicates of Fe and Mg”. Eg: Fayalite, forsterite.
• Sedimentary rocks have more of secondary minerals.
• Muscovite alters to “hydrous mica”.
• The insoluble residual material left behind during weathering is called as “saprolite”.
• The phenomenon of weathering of surface layer of rocks due to differential co-efficient of
expansion and contraction leading to ultimate disintegration is called “exfoliation”.
• The material deposited due to melting of ice or glacier in warm regions forms a structureless
mass and is termed “moraine or till”.
• Chemical weathering of feldspar produces clay mineral.
• Basalt decomposes more easily than granite.
• Ease of weathering of minerals
Quartz > Feldspar > Micas > Olivines > Hornblende.
• Weathering is a denstructive process whereas soil formation is a constructive porcess in
nature.
• Relief: It is defined as the elevations and inequalities of a land surface considered
collectively. “Topograpy” is similar to relief to be used on contour maps.
• The time devoted by nature to the formation of soil is known as “pedogenic time”.
• The process leading to the development of “soil profile” is called “pedogenic process”.
• “Humification” is the process of decomposition of raw O.M into humus. This process
usually takes place in surface or O horizon.
• ‘Eluviation” is the process of removal of constituents by percolation from upper layer to
lower layer (wash out).
• “Illuviation” is the deposition of dissolved material in the lower layers (wash in).
• “Podzole” means ash like under. Podzolisation is humid temperate type of soil forming
process. It is opposite to “calcification”.
• Laterization is the process of soil formation in tropics and sub-tropics. Laterization is the
process of removal of “silica” instead of “sesquioxides” from the upper layers.
• Laterization and podzolisation form soils belonging to the group of “pedalfer”.
• “Calcification” occurs in areas where there is insufficient rainfall.
• The soils which are having high saturation of ‘Ca’ are called as “pedocals”.
• “Decalcification” is the removal of ‘Ca’ ions (or) CaCO3 by leaching.
• “Cation exchange capacity” is expressed as me/100 g of soil or cmol (p) kg-1 soil.

•

Soil cations are sometimes called as “swarm ions” because they resemble swarm of bees
around a beehive.
The area in which the ions are moving around root (or) clay particle in soils is called
“oscillation zone”.
CEC of kaolinite increases as the pH of soil increases.
Total exchangeable bases (m.e/100 g.soil)
% of base saturation =

X 100
CEC

•
•

Arid region soils have high B.S than soils of humid region.
Soils which have higher B.S one dominated by 2:1 clay minerals like montmorillonite,
vermiculite, chlorite, micas.
• Anion exchange is more in soils high in 1:1 clay.
• Acid soils are poor in available Ca and Mg.
• Availability of ‘S’ is not affected by soil reaction as the sulphur compounds are soluble in
whole pH range.
• When pH is low, solubility of Fe, Mn, Al increases.
• Availability of B, Cu, Zn is reduced when the pH is increased.
• Availability of Mo is reduced in acid soils.
• “Buffering” refers to resistance to slight change in pH.
• The power to resist slight change in pH is called “buffer action”.
• Horizons in a soil profile are broadly divided into 4 groups and are called A, B, C, D.
• AB horizons are collectively called as ‘solum’. The solum together with parent material is
called “soil profile”.
• “Horizon” – A layer of soil approximately parallel to the land surface.
• The diagnostic surface horizons are called “epipedons”.
• When larger mineral particles dominate, soil is said to be “gravelly” (or) sandy. When the
mineral colloids dominate it is “clayey”.
• Compact soils and sandy soils have high bulk density.
• B.D. is more in lower layers of the profile because of less O.M.
• Addition of organic matter lowers the B. D and increases the porespace.
• Due to leaching of Fe compounds due to high rainfall, “grey (or) grey brown” soils are
formed.
• Hue – refers to the dominant spectral colours.
• Value – refers to the relative lightness (or) darkness of colour.
• Chroma – relative purity of a colour.
• “Soil consistence” is a dynamic property of soils which is expressed by the degree and kind
of “cohesion and adhesion”.
• Non – exchangeable cations in montmorillonite – Mg, illite – K.
• The organic matter on decomposition gets modified and acquires the properties of
“Colloids”.
• “Soil survey” is the study and mapping of soils in their natural environment.
• “Remote sensing” is the science and art of acquiring the information about objects from
distance without physically going in contact with the object.
• Pedalfers – Accumulation of iron – aluminium in soils under high rainfall.
Pedocals – Accumulation of ‘Ca’ – in areas of low rainfall

In soils, bauxite is the dominant oxide of aluminium.
Bluish and greenish colour of soil indicate ill drained condition.
The porosity and permeability of 1:1 clay mineral is high.
Ca & Mg have specified role of flocculation.
Total pore space is more in “clayey soils”.
Many fungi are soil inhabitants living as saprophytes on dead organic matter.
A larger proportion of plant nutrient present in the soil are in organic form.
The CEC of inorganic colloids is less than organic colloids.
Saline woils are dominated by chlorides and sulphates.
The hydrogen ion concentration of soil solution is called – Active acidity.
Limonite – 2Fe2O3. 3H2O.
Climate and biosphere are the active factors involved in the soil formation.
Humus theory was proposed by “von Liebig”.
The number of textural classes in the textural triangle is 12.
The steps involved in the development of soil structure are flocculation and aggregation.
In the arid regions with imperfect drainage, the most preferred cation for adsorption on soil
colloid is Na.
The soil/parent material is said to be colluvial if it is formed due to gravity.

“Soil fertility” is defined as the quality that enables a soil to provide the proper nutrient
compounds in proper amounts.
“Soil productivity” is defined as the capability of soil for producing a specified plant.
’Criteria of essentially of elements were proposed by Arnon in 1954..
“D.J. Nicholas” advanced the term “Functional (or) metabolic nutrient”.
1. Deficient: when an essential element is at lower concentration that severely limits yields
and produces deficient symptoms.
2. Insufficient: When the level of an essential element is below that required for optimum
yields (or) when there is an imbalance with another nutrient.
3. Toxic: When the conc. of either essential (or) other elements is sufficiently high to
reduce plant growth severely.
4. Excessive : When the concentration of an essential plant nutrient is sufficiently high to
result in corresponding shortage of another nutrient.
Establishment of essentiality of elements:
Nitrogen – Theodore de Saussure;
Mo – Arnon and stout,
Na – Brownell and wood;
Co-Ahmed and evans.

Some elements like Ca and Mg counteract toxic effects of other elements – balancing
function.
Ionic forms of nutrients absorption: Nitrogen – NO3 ; NH4+; Mo – MoO4--; P – H2PO4-, 1; C
– CO3--; HCO3-; S – SO4-2, B – BO3-3, HB4O7-.
Absorbed nutrients (exchangeable ions) are always in equilibrium with dissoloved fraction.
Hydrogen ions are leased to the medium in exchange for metal cations and OH- (or) HCO3are released in exchange for anions.
In passive absorption ions move into a cell along their electrochemical potential gradient
without expenditure of energy by the cell.
Mass flow hypothesis – Eg: Cl-, SO4-2, NO3-, Ca and Mg which occur in sufficient quantity
in soil solution.
Diffusion: Along concentration gradient – Mulder. Eg: P, K, Zn, Cu, the concentration of
which is low in soil solution.
Ion exchange:
a. Carbonic acid theory: Na+, K+, Ca++.
b. Contact exchange hypothesis – Jenny and Over Street. It takes place between
plant root and clay surface due to overlapping of oscillation volumes around the
adsorption site.
Donnon equilibrium theory: When a different ion of similar charge is present in the external
medium there will be no exchange.

Active absorption mechanisms:
1. Lundegardh’s hypothesis: Uptake of salt dependent of “anion” respiration. Transport of
anions occurs through “cytochome system”.
2. Carrier hypothesis: Requires ATP.

Mineralisation :
1. Aminisation: Hydrolytic decomposition of proteins results in the release of amines and
amino acids.
2. Ammonification: The amines and amino acids released are coverted to ammonium
compounds.
3. Nitrification : Biological oxidation of ammonium ions to NO3 is known as nitrification.
• Aminisation, ammonification – Heterotropic bacteria.
Nitrification – autotrophic bacteria; NH4
NO2- - Nitrosomonas, nitrococcus
NO2
NO3- Nitro bacter.
• The nitrosomonas, nitrobacter are usually refered to as the “nitrobacteria”.
• High C:N ratio prevents the release of ammonia. If the ammonia is present in too high
conentration, it constrains the nitrification.
• Nitrification will be appreciable at filed capacity of soil moisture content and takes place
even at (or) below the wilting coefficient.
• Nitrification takes place at a pH 5.5 to 10.
• If C:N ratio is more than 30:1 favours immobolisation and less than 30:1 favours
mineralization.
• Several clay minerals with 2:1 type structure have the capacity to fix ammonium and K ions.
“Vermiculite” has the highest CEC and hence high fixing capacity.
• Ammonium fixation by clay mineral is greatest in subsoil than the top soil because of higher
clay content of subsoil.
• Leaching losses of NO3 is low in unirrigated, arid, and semi - arid region and high in humid
areas where irrigation is practiced.
• NO3 ion are reduced to N2 in poorly drained and low in aeration soils by denitrification.
Eg: Thiobacillus denitrificans; Pseudomonas denitrificant.
• Volatilization: Application of ammonium containing fertilizers (or) urea which hydrolyses
to NH3 gas. The escape of ammonia gas into atmosphere is called volatilization. .
• The BNF in different organisms is brought about by enzyme “nitrogenase” enzyme.

Phosphorus has been considered “key to life”.
P contaning Ca minjerals in soils are mostly apatites – Ca10(PO4)6.
Flour apatite – 3Ca3(PO4)2.CaF2,
Carbonate apatite – 3Ca(PO4)2.CaCO3.
Oxy apatite – 3Ca3(PO4)2.CaO.
Hydroxy apatite – 3Ca3(PO4).Ca(OH)2,
Tricalcium phosphate (TCP)– Ca3(PO4)2
OCP – Ca8H2(PO4)65H2O.
Dicalcium phosphate – CaHPO4. 2H2O
MCP – Ca(H2PO4)2. H2O
Of all the above, the readily available for plant are mono calcium phosphates.
The apatite minerals are the most insoluble and unavailable of the group.
Phytin is a calcium – magnesium salt of “phytic acid”. Phytin is the most abundant of the
known organic ‘P’ compound.
Monovalent forms are preferred by plant than divalent (or) trivalent.
H2PO4- proportion is high at pH 5.0, HPO4-2 is high at pH 9.0 (very alkaline soil).
6.5 to 7.5 pH is considered to be best for optimum availability of ‘P’.
Phosphate fixation is more in 1:1 type of clay minerals.
Goethite – Fe2O3 3H2O.
Gibbisite – Al2O3 3H2O,
The concentration of ‘P’ in the soil solution is the measure of “intensity factor” (I) of ‘P’
nutrition.
The source of soil solution P replenishment is known as the quantity factor (Q) of P
nutrition.
‘P’ compounds in soils are categorised in three major groups
1. Readily available – soil solution P
2. Slowly available – labile P
3. Very slowly available – non – labile P.
Tropical clay soils high in Fe and Al need a high level of Q to assure a given I level.
Potential buffering capacity (PB C) = Q/I.
Total P content in plant ranges from 0.03 to 0.3%; In seeds upto – 1.5%.
Excess of P causes trace element deficiency particularly Fe and Zn.
Dificiency of P causes bronzing of leaf margins in cereals.

K
Orthoclase – KAlSiO3O8 – K Feldspar.
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

1:1 type minerals like ‘kaolinite’ do not fix ‘potassium’.
Illite fixes – K ions. Al+3 cations will occupy the K selective binding sites.
All K above the optimum level is considered as a luxury . Luxury consumption becomes
particulary wasteful.
K regulates water movement within plant cell.
‘K’ deficiency leads to “leaf scorching” (or) popularly known as “tip burning”.
Reduced crop yields without the appearance of definite symptoms is called “hidden
hunger”.
The function of K is catalytic in nature.
Secondary nutrients include Ca, Mg & S.

Ca: •
•
•
•
•

Ca is mostly present as primary minerals such as “basic plagioclase”.
Ca is the most dominant cation in all soils. Calcite – CaCO3.
Light textured soils suffer greater loss of Ca than heavy soils.
Ca is essential for formation of cell wall.
Deficiency symptoms:
1. Failure of terminal bud development.
2. In fruit trees “dieback”.
3. In guava cold leaves are chlorotic with red brown spots.
4. Severe loss of colour in young leaves of “brassica sps”.

Mg: If large qualitative of Mg salts are added to soils containing montmorillonite, the minerals are
altered to vermiculites.
•
•
•
•

It is low in acid soils.
Dolamite limesote is the richest source of Mg.
Mg is constituent of chlorophyll and maintains dark green colour.
In sandy soils too much ‘Mg’ may create ‘K’ deficiency.

•
•
•
•
•

‘S’ behaves like nitrogen in many respects
Sulphates are present in subsoils that contain 1:1 clays.
‘S’ is present in the oils of plants of mustard and onion families.
Sulphide production in paddy soils causes a disease known as “Akhiochi” (or) H2S injury.
Due to H2S injury, bubbles will be coming out from the affected areas. Soil colour will be
black.
“Akhiochi” disease occurs in soils that are lacking ‘iron’.

S :-

•

Micronutrients: Viets classification (1962).
Pool A : Water soluble ions. It is usually non existent for Cu and Zn, very small for Fe & Mn. Low
redox potential and low pH increase Mn & Fe but not Cu and Zn.
Pool B: Cations exchangeable by NH4. It is small for Cu and Zn.
Pool C: Cations exchangeable only by strong chelating agents like EDTA, DTPA.
Pool D: Micro – nutrient cations held in secondary clay minerals.
Pool E: Cations held in primary minerals.
•
•
•
•
•

Chlorides occur mostly in Pool A and Pool E.
Borates – Pool E.
Molybdates – Occur in all the pools.
Mo – Ultra basic rocks; Cu – basic rocks.
Micronutrients are more concentrated on the surface soil.
Presence of moisture reduces availability of Cu & Zn and increases Fe & Mn.

Low Si/Mg ratio – Leads to fixation of Zn in soils.
More of CaCO3 percent in soil, leads to the less availability of Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu and increases
the Mo availability.
Boron is available in more amounts in coarse soils.
‘B’ deficiency is commonly associated with dry areas.
Antagonism effect: Most of the micro nutrients are not available due to the antagonism
effect shown by them.
Mn vs Fe,
Fe vs Zn,
Cu vs Mo.

B:- It is the only non - metal among the micronutrients.
• ‘Tourmaline’ is the main boron containing mineral found in most soils.
• Boron fixation is more in fine textured soils.
• Borax – Na2B4O7 . 10H2O.
• ‘B’ indicator plants – sunflower. cabbage, cauliflower, sugarbeet.
• B deficiency causes
heart rot/crown rot of sugarbeet.

Deficiency causes white foliage in nurseries.

Mn:- Legumes show ‘Mn’ deficiency.
• Red soils contain more ‘Mn’.
• It is constituent of nitrite – reductase and hydroxylamine reductase.
• It involves in ‘Hill reaction and Calvin cycle’.
• Deficiency symptom: “Pahala blight” of sugarcane.
“Grey speck” of oat
• Paddy is more susceptible for Mn deficiency. Symptoms develop early on 3rd emerging leaf.
• Mn toxicity is very common on acid soils.

Wulfenite – PbMoO4

Powellite – CaMoO4.

It is a constituent of “nitrate reductase”.
Deficiency causes “whip tail” in cauliflower.
The toxicity of molybdenum on animal health was “teartness” (molybdenosis).

It requires for the synthesis of ‘tryptophan’.
It is a constituent of alcohol dehydrogenase and galactose oxidase enzymes.
Deficiency in rice – ‘khaira’.
‘Zn’ deficiency is cotton – little leaf:
Maize – white bud.
Critical pH range for availability of Zn is 5.5 to 6.5.
Problem soils:

•

Leaching is problem in humid regions and salt accumulation is a problem in arid and semi arid regions.
• Soil becomes “Saline” in areas where annual evaporation exceeds annual precipitation.
• Beans are damaged by chloride in the soil solution at equal ostmatic pressure, which
sulphates do not harm the crops.
• Grasses are more tolerant to chlorides than sulphates at equal O.P.
• At very high O.P, magnesium is more toxic than ‘Ca’ than Na.
• A soil which does not permit the normal growth of plant is a “Problem soil”.
1. Acid soils: Two types in AP..
a. Laterite soils - These are open textured with “massive structure”.
b. Ferrugenous red soils – derived from crystalline metamorphic rocks.
• Humus is a final product of organic matter decomposition.
• Lime as a reclaiming agent: calcite limestome – CaCO3,
dolamite limestone – CaCO3 MgCO3.
Quick lime – CaO, Blast furnace slage – CaSiO3 (by product of iron industry).
• Due to high soil acidity, Al, Mn, Fe, become highly solubulized and available in toxic
amounts.
• In acid soils activity of bacteria and actinomycetes is adversely affected. Fungi are active in
acid pH.
• All the micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Co) except Mo are available in the acid pH. Mo
deficiency has been identified in leguminous crops.
• In saline soils increasing osmotic pressure result in decreasing water availability to plants.
• In alkali soils high exchangeable Na depress the availability of Ca & Mg.

Manures and fertilizers:
Manuring: It is the process of improving productive capacity of the soil by adding more
plant nutrients to the soil in different forms.
Fertilisers are inorganic salts except “urea and calcium cyanamide”.
Decomposition of manures is allowed to reduce the wide C:N ratio to about 25:1.
The N fraction of FVM is mainly given by “Urine”.
Old and sick animals produce FYM rich in nutrients.
“Byre system of collection” is followed in government farms and in advanced countries to
collect FYM.
Composting: Converting organic materials into manure in a short time by accelerating
fermentative process under controlled conditions.
Composting earthworm – Eisenia foetida.
In ADCO method compost is similar to FYM and hence also called ‘synthetic FYM’.
The starter in ADCO method – ADCO accelerate – (NH4)2SO4. The compost was called
‘ADCO complete’. ADCO process was developed by ‘Hutchison and Richards”.
“Activated compost process” is a never ending composting process developed by Fowler
and his associates
“Banglore method” was developed by ‘Dr. C.N. Acharya’. It is a cheaper method. In this
method decompostionof O.M is not so well but N and O.M. are conserved very well.
In rural composting over the organic wastes dung water is sprinkled as a starter.
In urban composting starter is “night soil”.
“CuSO4” powder is added to reduced the offensive odour which is due to the foul smelling
organic compounds called “mercaptans”.
Sewage: Drainage water that is taken out of the cities and towns through underground
drainage pipe system including night soil.
Sewerage: The pipe system laidout in municipalities and cities to take the drainage water out
of the cities.
Sullage: Refers to the drainage water takenout of the municipalities through open channels.
Does not contain night soil.
Effluent: The supernatant liquid that floats over the drainage water is allowed to settle in the
tank.
Sludge: The solid portion of drainage that settles at the bottom of the tank.
Activated sludge: The settlement of the solid material is made fast by pumping air into the
tanks.
In activated sludge salts like FeCl2; FeSO4 are added to activate certain bacteria called “Iron
bacteria”.
The optimum time of incorporation of the green manure crop in the soil is during flowering.

1. Transient binding agents – like gums & mucilage.
2. Temporary binding agents – Fine roots of the plants as well as the “fungal hyphae”.
3. Presistent binding agents – Microbial secretions.
Persistant binding agents along with inorganic substances like Fe & Al oxides act as
permanent binding agent.
“Daincha” is grown to open the hard deep layers of the soil. It is not a fodder crop and is
suitable for “sodic soils” (or) “alkali soils”.
Pourdrette – form of night soil.
Biggest compost plant – Tel Aviv (Israil)
Bone meal is effective in soils with more Fe & Al.
If inorganic fertilizers are added to the soil year after year it leads to salinity resulting in
“exosmosis”. This can be avoided by adding of B.M.
Blood meal:
1. Red product: Got by drying blood in super heated steam.
2. Black product: Got by drying blood on a sand bath.
“Guano” is a product obtained from sea birds.
Guano is treated with H2SO4 in order to allow hydrolysis and convert the organic nutrients
into inorganic nutrients. This is called “artificial guano”.
Lessen the oil content greater the decomposition.
Chile saltpeter – NaNO3 – rich deposit of NO3.
To get 1 kg of ‘N’ in the form of fertilizer about 40,000 kilo joules of energy is needed.
In “Haber – Bosch” process N is made to combine with H2 under optimum conditions of
5500C temp; 200atm pressure and activated iron oxide” as a catalyst.
The source for N2 is the ‘atmospheric N’
H2O is used as a source of H2 in countries where electricity is cheap.
“National fertilizers Ltd” at Nangal (Punjab) uses water as a source.
About 64% of ammonia produced in the world use “natural gas” as a source of H2.
Eg: Nagarjuna fertilizers.
“Naptha” is a light distillation fraction of petrol (or) crude oil. About 75% of nitrogenous
fertilizers produced in India use ‘naptha’. Naptha is essentially a mixture of “hydrocarbons”.
The heavy distillate fraction of crude oil is called fuel oil.
‘Ramagundam’ plant used coal as a source H2.
Coal also can be used as a source of N2.
In steel industries lot of coal is burnt to melt iron and “Coke oven” gas is get as by -product.
NH3 contain 82% N.
NH3 is soluble in water to an extent of 30% by wt. This is called “liquor ammonia” (or)
“aqua NH3”.
NH3 is a cheapest source of N fertilizer.
1 kg NH3 needs 1.8 kg lime to neutralize acidity developed.
Ammonium sulphate is manufactured by the
1. Coke oven gas process – Bituminous coal is subjected to destructive distillation. It
contains 10% NH3 by volume.
2. 85% of (NH4)2 SO4 manufactured in India is by “Gypsum process”.
(NH4)2 SO4 is white crystalline salt, but commercially vary from yellow to gray due to
impurities like ferric cyanide, arsenous sulphides (or) traces of tar
“Thiocyanates” present are toxic to plants. So the (NH4)2 SO4 are periodically checked.
110 kg of CaCO3 is needed to neutralize the acidity created by 100 kg of (NH4)2 SO4.
1kg of N applied as ammonium sulphate requires 5.1kg of lime for neutralization.

NH4Cl is very popular in Japan and S.E. Asia. It is prepared by
1. Direct neutralization process.
2. Dual salt (or) modified Salvay process. Here NH4Cl is salted out by NaCl using the
principle of “common ion effect”.
CAN is a mixture of NH4NO3 and CaCO3.
Fine granules of CAN are coated with soap stone powder i.e. MgSiO3 which improves the
free flowing character of the fertilizer and it acts as a conditioner.
“Urea (or) carbamide” has N in organic form, non-ionic form (or) amide form.
82% of N requirement of the crops in India is by urea.
When temperature exceeds 1000C, urea produces a toxic product called “biuret”. Biuret has
less amount of ‘N’.
NH2 – CO – NH – CO – NH2.
The amount of biuret cantent in urea should not exceed 1.5%; when urea is being used as a
feed to cattle the biuret content should be less than 0.5%.
When soil is acidic, ammonical fertilizers should not be recommended as they increase
acidity.
For paddy ammonical fertilizers are preferable as paddy takes N in the form of NH4+
PO4-3 which is unavailable form after being added to soils. H2PO4- & HPO4-2 are available
forms.
Rock phosphate formed from primary minerals is “magmatic origin” and that formed due to
teeth and bones is called “organogenic origin”.
“Morocco” occupies first place in deposits of P. The rock phosphate here is of organogenic
origin.
The rock Phosphate of N. Africa is very soft and finely crystalline and is called “Galsa
phosphate”.
In USA rock phosphate is present in the form of “pebbles”.
In USSR rock phosphate is very hard and called “Kolaphosphats”.
“Rock phosphate” is the basic raw material for manufacturing any phosphatic fertilizer.
Rock phosphate when treated with H2SO4 give SSP; when treated with H3PO4 gives ‘TSP’.
H3PO4 can directly used as a liquid fertilizer.
“Soft earth” of R.P is best for acidic soils, for grasslands, pastures and orchards where the
‘P’ requirement is needed over a long period of time.
“Mussoire R.P” is the raw material used for manufacture of P fertilizers in India.
“River pebble phosphate (or) waste pond phosphate” is colloidal phosphates mineral
phosphate, calphos.
The fine powder of R.P is called “float”.
SSP is produced by two process.
1. Dean process
2. Continuous rock acidulation process.
The toxic compounds like ‘F’ present in R.P are eliminated as HF.
SSP contains 2/5 of Ca(H2PO4)2 &3/5 of gypsum by wt.
There are 2 grades of SSP available in India.
1. 14% P2O5
2. 16% P2O5 (i.e. 7%P) [PX2.29 = P2O5].
‘TSP’ does not have gypsum so it is completely soluble in water.
“Basic slag” is a by product of steel industry (in open hearth process) and is called “Thomas
slag”.

Schoenite – K2SO4 MgSO4 Sylvite – KCl.
Sylvinite – KCl NaCl
Langbeinite – K2SO4 2MgSO4
Removal of clay particle form sylvinite is called “Desliming” slurry is coated with starch to
prevent remaining clay to combine with floating reagents.
Most of the KCl is prepared by “Floatation process”.
For K2SO4 preparation, raw materials are langbeinite and sylvite (in Mannhein process).
Any fertilizer containing 3 nutrients it is a “complete fertilizer”. If there are 2, It is called
“multi nutrient fertilizer”.
Complex fertilizers are homogenous, mixed fertilizers are heterogenous among commonly
used complete fertilizer.
Ammonium phosphate – Factammophos; nitrophosphate – Suphala.
When straight fertilizers are mixed in large quantities it is called as bulk blended fertilizer
(BBF).
All the properties of fertilizer which affect the flow of fertilizers through distribution
equipment are collectively called “drillability”.
Granular fertilizers are more easily drillable compared to pulverized fertilizers.
Cracking in fertilizer mixture can be reduced by adding conditioners.
Crystal knitting is a process of formation of new compounds due to crystallization with a
change in temperature and moisture of the fertilizer when the fertilizer is under pressure.
Double decomposition occurs between two compounds that do not have a common ion.
Unit cost of N in urea is cheapest among all.
1. NO3- fertilizers are recommended in acid soils with a pH of 5.0.
2. Both forms (NH4+ & NO3-) for pH 5-7.
3. NH4+ is effective in neutral and slightly alkaline soils of pH 7.0-7.5.
4. NH4+ fertilizers are inferior in highly alkaline soils as NH4+ reacts with OH- forming
H2O & NH3. NH3 is lost as a gas.
The part of fertilizer available to succeeding crop other than for which it is applied is called
“residual effect”.
NH4 fertilizer should be avoided in highly acidic soils.
NO3- fertilizer should be avoided in “coarse soils” as more leaching is there.
KCl has more salt index than K2SO4.
Salt index is defined as the ratio of the increase in osmatic pressure produced by the given
fertilizer to that produced by the same weight of NaNO3. Salt index of NaNO3 is given as
“100”.
Ca & Mg deficiency is seen in only acid soils & ‘S’ in alkaline soils.
Ca is needed in large quantities for root development. Hence, called root developer.
In delta areas silt is added to the soil indirectly called “wraping” through letting into the
fields with proper bunds of the silt laden flood waters.

Water in the small pores move because of capillary force and is called “Capillary water”. It
moves more freely than free water. It can move in any direction, but always in the direction
of “Increasing tension”.
Thin film around soil particles that cannot be used by plants is called “Hygroscopic water”.
Capillary movement is by adhesive and cohesive forces.
Water moves from saturated soil to unsaturated layers.
In moist soils water movement is more uniform than in dry soils.
At saturation, capillary movement is most rapid in sandy soils and slowest in clay soils. But
in unsaturated, capillary movement is rapid in clay and slow in sandy soils.
Adhesion - attraction of soil particle and water.
Cohesion - between water molecule.
Soil moisture tension is a measure of the tenacity with which water is retained in the soil
and shows the force per unit area that must be exerted to remove water from the soil. It is
usually expressed in atmosphere.
Soil moisture tension does not indicate the amount of water. To show the amount of
moisture a given soil holds at various tension.
“Moisture extraction curves” (Soil moisture characteristic curves) must be develoed.
PF is defined as the logarithm of height in a column of water. Pf value of saturated soil is
‘O’.
At Field capacity pF 2.54; P.W.P - 4.2 soil moisture tension - 15 bars.
Movement of irrigation water from the surface into the soil through the soil is called “Water
intake = Percolation + Infiltration”.
Infiltration is the downward flow of water from the surface into the soil.
Percolation is the movement of water through soil profile.
Percolation rate is governed by the permeability (or) Hydraulic conductivity of the soil.
Permeability is the quality of soil that enables it to transmit air and water.
Hydraulic conductivity is the co-efficient ‘K’ (Proportionality factor).
Darcy’s law = V = Ki
V = Effective flow velocity
i = Hydraulic gradient
‘K’ depends on the properties of fluid as well as the soil.
Seepage is the lateral movement of water in the soil.
Leaching is removal of soluble salts by passage of water through soil.
Field capacity is the amount of water a well drained soil held after free water had drains
against held gravity.
Available water = F.C - PWP
1/3 atmospheric tension is usually taken as field capacity of the soil
Permanent wilting point is the soil moisture to meet transpiration requirements.
Ultimate wilting point - At this point the plant will die even after providing water.
A higher water table limits root growth and a raised water table may kill rooots.
The usual water extraction pattern 40% moisture from the upper quarter 30% from second
quarter, 20% from III, 10% from IV quarter.
Effective root zone depth is the soil depth from which the crop extracts most of the water
needed for “evapo transpiration”.
Safflower - very deep root system, cotton - deep root system
Soil crusting reduces infiltration.

Certain stages in the crop growth period are made sensitive to soil moisture stress compared
with others. These are known as “Moisture sensitive” or “Critical periods”.

Crop
Moisture sensitive period
Rice, Finger millet
- Primordia development, heading, flowering
Sorghum
- Booting, Blooming
Maize
- Tasseling, Silking
Wheat
- Crown-root initiation
Groundnut
- Peg penetration, flowering
Sunflower
- Two weeks before flowering to 2 WAF
Safflower
- From rosette to flowering
Cotton
- Flowering, boll development
Tobacco
- Tapping stage
Potato

The periods in days during which irrigation water is supplied to the crop is termed as “Base
period”.

• Irrigation project constructed during British period Godavari delta system
• Consumptive use is the amount of water needed for transpiration + evaporation + used by
vegetation for metabolic activities.

• Measurement of soil moisture:
Direct method measures direct water content.
Indirect method measures water potential.

• Gravimetric method is a standard method.
• Spirit burning method is rapid and suitable for field.
• In Neutron moisture meter - A probe and a scaler (or) counter are present. The probe
consists of a source of fast neutron (mixture of Radium - Barrylium). It is not suitable for
measuring moisture content very near to the soil surface.

• Tensiometer is useful in sandy soils.

Adoptation of a variety to a new environment is knows as “acclimatization”.
All dwarf wheat varieties are derived from crosses with “Mexican dwarf wheat”.
The gradual loss of variability in the cultivated forms and in their wild relatives is
referred to a “Genetic erosion”.
Gene santuries – May be defined as an area of diversity protected from interference from
man.
“Exploration” are trips for the purpose of collection of various forms of crop plants and
their related species.
The fundamental steps of any breeding programme, are
1. Creation of variation
2. Selection.
The two basic requirements of selection to operate are
1. Variation must be present in the population.
2. The variation must be heritable.

If ‘n’ lines are to be tested in all possible single cross combinations there would be
n (n-1) / 2 single crosses without reciprocals and if reciprocals are also included it would
be n (n-1).
The concept of combining ability was proposed by Sprague and Tatum.
The ability of an inbred to transmit the desirable character to its hybrid progenies in
combination with another inbred line is known as “combining ability”.
The average performance of inbred in series of hybrid combinations is known as its
“General combining ability”. This is obtained by “top cross test”.
Specific combining ability: is a deviation from performance predicted on the basis of
GCA estimated by “Diallel crossing”.
Heterosis is mainly due to SCA.
Number of double cross combinations – n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)/8.
Synthetics are important in cross pollinated crops.
A “Synthetic” may be defined as an advanced generation of open pollinated seed
mixture of a number of inbred lines among them.
Synthetics only exploit GCA; but hybrids exploit both GCA and SCA.
Syn2 = Syn1 – (Syn1 – Syn0)/n.
n = no. of parental lines.
A “Composite” variety is produced by mixing seeds of several phenotypically
outstanding lines and allowing them to open pollinate in all possible combinations.
Germplasm complexes are produced by mixing seed from several lines (or) populations
of diverse genetic origin.
Recurrent selection: Method which involves “reselection” generation after generation
with interbreeding of selects to provide genetic recombination”.
In recurrent selection for GCA tester is “open pollinated variety” (broad genetic base).
In recurrent selection for SCA tester is an “inbred”. (narrow genetic base).
If dominance is in complete, Recurrent selection for GCA & reciprocal recurrent
selection are equal but both are superior to R.S for SCA.
If dominance is complete three methods are equal.
If over dominance is present, Reciprocal recurrent selection and recurrent selection and
recurrent selection and recurrent selection for SCA both equally superior to recurrent
selection and recurrent selection for GCA.
Male sterility is the condition in which non functional pollen grains are produced.
The male sterile line may be maintained by crossing it to a heterozygous male fertile.

The word economics was derived from Greek word “OIKONOMICAS”
OIKOS – House hold, NOMOS – Management.
Father of economics – “Adam Smith” (Book – Wealth of Nations).
The early form of economics is “Political Economy”.
The ‘subject matter’ comes under the scope of economics.
Economics is a science in methodology and an art in its application.
Micro economics is also known as “Price theory”.
Macro economic is also known as “Income theory”.
The theory of product pricing factor and economic welfare is micro economics.
Wants – efforts – satisfaction sums up the subject matter of economics
Dividing the money among the factors is ‘distribution’.
Micro and Macro economic terms were coined by “Ragnar frisch”.
Macro economics known as theory of income and employment of simply income
analysis.
Economics is primarily study of man and not of wealth.
Theory of economics has been systematically arranged into consumption, production,
exchange and distribution.
A positive science is concerned with “What is” and normative science with “What out to
be”.
Positive science is a “Pure science” and normative science is an ‘ethical Science’.
Deductive method come down from generals to particulars.
Inductive method come down from generals to particulars to the general.
Deductive method static approach and unbiased; inductive method dynamic approach &
biased.
“Economic laws” are statements of uniformities which govern human behavior
concerning the utilization of limited resources for the attainioment of unlimited ends –
Robbins.
Anything that can satisfy a human want is called “Good”.
“Services” refers to the work that a person may do
Good based
Supply Free goods – They have value in use but not values in exchange
Economic goods – They have both value in use and exchange.

Consumption
Transferability
•

•

Based on consumption :1. Consumer goods – Yield satisfaction directly. They are also called “Goods of the first
order”.
2. Producer goods – These help to produce other goods known as the “goods of the
second order”.
Good will of a business transferable.

Utility is the power of a good to satisfy human want.
Utility is subjective and relative.
The term utility has no ethical and moral significance.
Utility is measured in terms of units called “Units”.
Economists who contend that utility is measurable are called “Cardinalists”.
Economists who say that utility cannot be measured and who follow the approach are
called “Ordinalist”.
‘Value’ is defined as the power of a commodity to command other things in exchange for
itself.
When value is express interms of money it is called ‘Price’.
Wealth consists of all potentially exchangeable means of satisfying human needs.
Any thing which possess value in exchange is “Wealth”.
1. Social (or) Communal wealth – Parkes.
2. National wealth – Rivers.
3. Cosmopolition wealth – Rivers.
4. Negative wealth – Debts.
All money is wealth but all wealth is not money.
Wealth is fund and income is flow.
Wealth is the means to an end, welfare is the end itself.
Human wants is starting point of all economic activity and consumption is the end of all
economic activity.
Consumption is defined as destruction of utility.
“Want” may be defined as that desires which is accompanies by the capacity and
willingness to satisfy it.
Any single want is stabile leads to “law of diminishing marginal utility”.
Wants become habits led to Engels law of consumption function.
Necessaries of existence – Food, Clothing, Shelter.
Necessaries of efficiency – Vehicle for a doctor.
Conventional necessaries – Marriage dinner.
Defense luxuries – gold ornaments.
Law of diminishing marginal utility: Def: The additional benefit which a person derives
from a given increase of his stock (or) any thing diminishes with every increase in stock
that he already has – “Alfred Marshall”.
Marginal utility: It is the utility derived from the additional unit of a commodity
consumed.
Initial utility: It is the utility of first unit.
Zero utility: number of addition to the total utility. It also implies the “point of satisfy”.
When total utility is max, marginal utility is zero.
Law of diminishing marginal utility does not apply in the case of money.
Marginal utility of money for a rich man is less while it is high for a poor man.
Price measures the marginal utility (or) marginal utility indicates the price.
It is wrong to say that the marginal utility and price are governed by demand and supply.
Law of equi-marginal utility also called Law of substitution, Law of Max. satisfaction.
The law of diminishing marginal utility tells us the position of consumers, equilibrium in
the case of are commodity purchase.

The excess of the price which the consumer would be willing to pay rather than go
without the thing-over which he actually does pay is the economic measure of his surplus
satisfaction. It may be called “Consumers surplus”. It is based on the low of diminishing
marginal utility. (Alfred marshal).
C.S = What we are prepared to pay – what we actually pay.
C.S = Total utility – Total amount spent.
Fall in price will cause an increase in C.S. & rise in price, a fall in C.S.
Standard of living of the people means the quantity and quality of consumption.
“Demand schedule” is a list of quantities purchased (or) demanded at various issues in a
given period of time. It represents functional relationship b/n the price and the amount
demanded.
Graphic representation of demand schedule is called “demand curve”.
The slopping of demand curve is in accordance with the laws of diminishing marginal
utility.
In inferior goods (or) in Giffen’s goods a fall in price tends to reduce and a raise in price
tends to extend the demand.
Demand is a function of price.
Elasticity means sensitiveness (or) responsiveness of demand to the change in price.
Elasticity of demand = % of change in demand / % of change in price.
When a small change in price may lead to a great change in demand. The demand is
elastic. Even a big change in price is followed by only a small change in demand it is said
to be in elastic demand Eg: Salt
Cross elasticity : means a change in the demand for a commodity owing to a change in
the price of another commodity.
1. Perfectly elastic demand : Demand curve is horizontal to ‘X’ axis Ed = α
2. Perfectly in elastic demand : Demand curve is vertical straightline Ed = 0.
3. Relatively elastic demand :
P
= Ed >1

Ed = Elasticity of demand

Production should be defined as creating (or) addition of wealth (or) valuation.
Factor of production – Land, labour, Capital and organizations.
Land is fixed in quantity and lacks mobility.
Labour has no free mobility.
Territorial division of labour: It refers to certain localities specializing in the production
of some commodity. It is also called “Localisation of industries”.

2. Articles of association.
In public limited company – There is no max limit 2 min. limit is ‘Severe’.
Private limited company – min 2; Max. 50 members.
Co-operation means working together towards a common end. In producers co-operation
– elect the board of management using the principle of “one man one vote”.
Supply means the quantities that a seller is will in to and able to sell at different prices.
Stocks is the total volume of a commodity which can be brought into the market for sale
at short notice. Supply means the quantity which is actually brought in the market.
Supply curve has positive slope price

Elasticity of supply =
Percentage change in price
(or) Proportional change in price / Price

Elasticity of supply co-efficient is always positive.
Supply is said to increase when more is offered at the same price (or) the same quantity
offered at a lower price.
Supply is said to decrease when less is offered at the same price (or) the same quantity is
offered at higher price.
Exchange is the barter comparatively superfluous morethan enough for the comparatively
necessary (Jevans).
Generally acceptable medium of exchange – Money.

Some cost is incurred in making coin. This charge is higher than the cost it is termed
“Seignoirage” and if no charge is made and coins are minted free of cost the coinage is
“gratuitous”.
The wealth of a country depends on the labour and land.
The total supply depends upon the strength of population and its quality.
Malthusian theory of population: Thomas Robert Malthus wrote his essay on “Principles
of Population”.
Food increases in a arithmetical ratio, population increases in geometrical ratio.
Population can be check by
1. Preventive checks : by bringing down the birth rate.
2. Positive checks: By increasing the death rate.
The theory of optimum population was proposed by “Edwin cannan”. (Modern theory of
population).
Optimum population may be defined as the one at which per capita income is the highest.
Dalton’s formula for Mal adjustment.
Actual population deviates from optimum population. This deviation is called “Mal
adjustment”.
M = (A – O) / O
A = Actual population
O = Optimum population

“Capital formation” is the very core of the “Economic development”.
Murry and Nelson says “Capital formation” is called investment. The amount which a
community adds to it.
Capital formation represents the surplus of production over consumption.
In most under develop countries, investment is only 5.8% in developed countries 1520%.
Taxes by the government – “Forced savings”.
Organizing and risk taking are the two main functions of the organizer.

Credit: Prof. Galbraith defined credit as the temporary transfer of assets (or) wealth from
one who has to the other who has not.
Promissory notes are popularly known as I.O.U (I owe you).
Market – A particular place (or) building where the goods are purchased (or) sold.
Monopolistic competition refers to competition among large number of sellers producing
close but not perfect substituted products. (Heterogenous products).
For monopolistic competition the demand curve (or) sales curve (or) average revenue
curve, slope downwards to the right.
Oligopoly: A competition is called oligopolistic when few sellers of a product are found
in the market (Homogenous product).
Interdependence is the most important feature of Oligopoly.
Duopoly – two sellers (Homo & Hetero genous).
Monopoly : One seller (Homogenous)
The price at which demand and supply are equal is known as “equilibrium price”.
Price at which the willing to buy the commodity is known as “demand price”.
The price at which the seller is willing to offer his goods for sale is known as “Supply
price”.
The price will be settled according to the marginal utility of the consumers.
All commodities can have “Market price”; only reproducible commodities can have
“normal price” (long period price).
Demand play active role in market price; Supply play active role in “normal price”.
The national wealth is the source of distribution
1. Functional distribution : Refers to the share factors of production in the form of rent,
wages, interest. It is a “macro concept”.
2. Personal distribution: refers to the gives amount of income and wealth derived by
individual. It is a “micro concept”.
General theory of distribution – Marginal productivity theory. It is based on the – “law of
diminishing marginal returns”. This theory considers only demand but not supply.
Modern theory of distribution – Considers demand and supply.
Distribution refers to the sharing of wealth that is produced among the different factors of
production.
“Rent” refers to the remuneration that is paid for the use of the free gift of nature.
“David Ricardo” proposed a systematic theory of rent on “deductive basis”.
Ricardo theory based on the “law of diminishing returns”.
Rent is not price determined but price determining.
“Quasirent” is the surplus earned by instruments of production other than land.
A ‘wage’ may be defined as a sum of money paid under contract by an employer to a
worker for services renderd.
The demand for labour is ‘derived demand’. (for a factor of production)

maximum satisfaction.
Produced means of production – capital.
A tax whose impact and incidence are on the some person – Direct tax.
Monopoly is complete negation f competition.

Agricultural economics defined by Prof. Grey.
Problem of agriculture :
1. Production problem
2. Marketing problem
3. Financing
In earlier days production used to be “Consumption oriented” but in modern times
production is “Market oriented”.
Agricultural products are joint products.
The demand for agricultural products are ‘inelastic’.
Agricultural markets are not regulated.
1. Agricultural holding: The area of a land for cultivation as single unit.
2. Farm: Means a piece of land where crop and livestock enterprises are taken up.
3. Operational holding: Total area held under single management excludes leased land.
4. Technical unit: Single convenient unit in production for which technical co-effecients
are calculate. Eg: acre, ha.
Group of technical units: Plants (or) plant is a part of farm firm.
Farm firm: It is a production unit under one management and is also known as economic
unit.
Time required for a source to be completely transformed into a product is referred to as
‘transformation period’.
Choice indicator: It is a yard stick (or) an index (or) a criteria indicating which of two
(or) more alternatives is optimum (or) will maximize a given end. Choice indicators are
almost always given as “ratios”.
The short run is that period of time during which one (or) more of the production inputs
is fixed in amount and cannot be changed Long run – productive inputs can be changed.
Cost of production: Expenses incurred per unit quantity of output of a commodity.
“Technical efficiency” is the ratio of output to input “Economic efficiency” is the ratio of
value of output to value of input.
“Enterprise” is defined as single crop (or) livestock commodity being produced as a firm.
Agriculture production economics – Principles of choice are applied to the use of capital,
labour, land and management resources in the farming industry.
Production economics is concerned with productivity – deals with economic efficiency.
The scientific approach to the study of production economics involves deduction and
induction approaches.
Induction approach employ statistical modes.
1. Product – product relationship (what to produce).
2. Factor – factor relationship (How to produce).
3. Factor – Product relationship (How much to produce) (law of diminishing returns
employ this).
Factor – product relationship deals with the “Production efficiency of the resources”.
The goal of this relationship is the product maximization.
Farm management specialists cal this relationship as “input-output relationship” an
agronomist call as “fertilizer response curve”.
“Price ratio” used as choice indicator to determine the optimum quantity of input to use.
The relationship between inputs and outputs can be characterized as “Production
function”.

1. In continuous production function inputs and outputs can be split up into small units.
2. In discontinuous (or) discrete production function inputs and outputs cannot be
broken into smaller units.
Eg: Ploughing
Discrete viable can be known from “Counting”.
Linear equation of production function Y = a + bx.
Y = dependent variable
A = constant
B is coefficient
X = Independent variable
Y = axb is an exponential equation (Non-linear) and is known as “Cobb – Douglass”
production function.
Low of returns:
1. Low of increasing returns (Increasing marginal productivity)
Curve is convex
to the origin.
2. Law of constant returns (constant marginal productivity) curve is “ Concave to the
origin”.
3. Law of decreasing returns (decreasing marginal productivity) curve is “Concave to the
origin.
Law of diminishing returns also known as “Law of variable proportions”.
When MPP > APP; App increases.
MPP = APP; App will be maximum
MPP < APP; App decreases.

and substitution ratios are choice indicators.
An isoquant is a convenient device for compressing three dimensional picture of
production function into two dimensions.
Isoquant represents all possible combinations of two inputs physically capable of
producing given level of output.
Isoquants are also known as “Isoproduct curves” (or) Equal product curves” (or) “Product
indifferent curves”.
If number of isoproduct curves are drawn on one graph the figure is known “Isoquant
map”.

•

Isoquant show cardinal magnitudes.

MRTS of X2 for X1 denoted as ∆ X1/ ∆ X2; X1 for X2 as ∆ X2/ ∆ X1.
MRTS is lessthan zero incase of substitutes.
When two resources are completely interchangeable they are called “Perfect substitutes”.
The isoquants for perfect substitutes is negatively sloped [
] straight line.
Complements: The inputs which increase the output only when combined in a fixed
proportion are known as “Complements”.
Eg: Tractor worded by labour
In case of “perfect complements” isoquants are right angle
MRTS ≥ 0

“Substitution at decreasing rate is more common in agriculture.
Isoquants are convex to the origin when inputs substitutes at decreasing rate.
Iso cost lines (equal cost line, iso outlay lines, price lines factor cost lines).

The least cost combination is obtained when marginal ratio of substitution is equal to the
inverse price ratio of the resources.
The least cost combination will be at the point where isocost line is tangent to the
isoquant.
A line (or) curve connecting the least cost combination of inputs for all output level is
known as “Isocline” of many isoclines the isocline which is considered to be most
appropriate over a production period is known as “expansion path (or) scale line. At any
time only one expansion path is possible.
Ridge lines represent the points of maximum output from each input given a fixed
amount of other input.
Portion of isoquant which lie between the ridge lines are suited for economic production.
The main objective of product – product relationship is “maximization of profits”.
The principles of substitution and the law of equimarginal returns explain the product –
product relationship.
The production possibility curve presents all possible combinations of two products that
could be produced with given amounts of inputs (or) opportunity curve (or) Iso resource
curves (or) Transformation functions.

“Returns to scale” means the behavior of production when all productive factors are
increased (or) decreased simultaneously in the same ratio.
Returns to scale is “long run production factor”.
Law of variable proportion – short run production function.
Fixed costs are not under the control of the Manager in the production function.
Fixed costs are also called as “Sunkcosts”, “Overhead costs” indirect cost; supplementary
costs.
Variable costs are also known as “direct costs”, “prime costs”, short run costs.
Export costs are paid out costs.
Import costs are self owned and self owned self employed resources.

Alternative – macro.
First organized study in the field of farm cost accounting in 1923 – 24 by “Punjab board
economic enquiry”.
First all India studies of costs and returns an farmer holding was conducted by ICAR.

Summary of cost principle:Short run:
1. Expected selling price is greater than minimum ATC. A profit can be made and is
maximized by producing where MR = MC.
2. Expected selling price is lessthan minimum ATC but greater than minimum AVC. A loss
of expected but the loss will be lessthan TFC and minimized by producing at a point
where MR = MC.
3. Expected selling price is lessthan minimum AVC. A loss is expected but can be
minimized by not producing anything.
• Principles of equimarginal returns (or) opportunity cost principle.
• An optimum choice of enterprises is made based on the “Principle of equimarginal
returns”.
• The opportunity cost is the return sacrificed from the next best alternative.

Agricultural marketing: It is the study of all activities, agencies and policies involved in
the procurement of farm inputs by the farmer and the movement of products from the
farms to the consumer.
Agricultural marketing system is a link between farm and non farm sectors.
Markaetable surplus:- It is the total quantity of commodity available with the producer
for marketing after meeting the normal requirement for house hold consumption.
Marketed surplus: It is the quantity of produces which the farmer sells in the market at a
particular point of time.
Marketing function: Any single activity perform in carrying the produce from the point of
production to the ultimate consumer.
Market functionaries:
1. Merchant middle man: Eg: whole salers, Retailers. Who take the title of the
commodity. They take the title of the product.
2. Agent middle men: They do not take the title of the product.
3. Speculative middle man: They take the title of the product and their main intension is
to make maximum profit.
4. Facilitating middle man: They do not take the title of the product.

specific marketing agency.
Marketing channel: These are the routes through which are the commodities moves
from the producer to the consumer.
Grading: It is the sorting of unlike lots into homogenious lots.
1. Fixed grading: Standards are fixed (Mandatory grading).
2. Permissive grading: Individual choice are permitted.
Market intelligence: It gives the information regarding prices, demand and supply.
Market finance: It is the finance given to the farmer during a time period from
harvesting and disposal of the commodity at a remunerative price. Distress sales can be
avoided –
In 1. Village market transaction between buyers and sellers.
2. Primary wholesale market between farmers and traders.
3. Secondary whole sale market between (1) . Whole sellers, and 2. Wholesellers.

The best season to take cutting is from middle of July to middle of February.
In graftage the upper part is termed as “Scion” and the lower part is termed as “root
stock”. The new plant obtained as a result is called “Stion”.
The root stock is selected on the basis of the influence on the ‘Scion’.
The shoots of mother tree from which the buds are used as scion material is known as
‘bud wood’.
Top working is the practice of grafting on established trees which involves the removal of
most of their branch system. To re - juvinate old unproductive tree.
A scion is grafted over the already grafted shoot. This is known as “Double” working.
Double working is done to temper the influence of the rootstock.
“Bridge grafting” is a form of repair grafting and is used in cases in which the root
system of the tree has not been damaged but where there is injury to the bark of the trunk.
The influence of root stock is more in magnitude as compared to the influence of scion as
stock.
Precocity: from planting to flowering period – early bearing nature.
Effect of root stock on the vigour of the scion on precocity on productivity and yield.
The major influence of the scion on the rootstock is on the vigour of the stock.

Method of pruning:
1. Thinning out: When a shoot is removed entirely from the jinception.
2. Heading back: When a branch is cut almost to the base, leaving a few inches at
stump, carrying few buds, it is referred as “Heading back”.
3. Pollarding – Mere cutting back of the shoots to reduce in the height of the tree is
“Pollarding”.
4. Training – Cutting the growth of the twig.
5. Pinching (Tipping) – Removal of the tip of the shoot. This is practiced in marigold
and chillies at the time of transplanting.
6. Disbudding – Nipping (or) rubbing.
7. Deblossoming – Removal of surplus flowers practiced in alternate bearers take

the harvest of the crops.
Trees on light soils flower earlier than those on heavy soils.
An accumulation of carbohydrates is essential for flower formation.
Bahar treatment is given to produce flowers. This is mainly practiced in citrus (Santra) in
Nagpur area.
Ringing: The bark is removed in the form of a ring from small branches. Ringing is
practiced in grape and deciduous fruits in Europe.

bud formation. Smudging is a practice based on this principle.
Rumani prefers Himayuddin polles
Waves of fruit drop
I. wave (post – setting drop) – This drop is natural and beneficial to the plant. It is a
necessary evil.
II. Wave (Summer (or) June drop) – due to high temperature shedding (thinning) helps
the remaining fruits on the tree of increase in size.
III. Wave (Pre-harvest drop) – Cause heavy losses.
Late rains may prolong the vegetative growth and delay (or) reduce flowering as in
Mango. It can be remedied by drying out the soil by deep ploughing and probably by
artificial inhibition of growth by growth inhibitors (Cycocel B9).

“Penetrometer” measure firmness as an index of maturity.
Acidity and as tringency gradually disappear during ripening.
Aroma and taste together constitutes the favour. The aroma is cause by the formation of
ester.
During the time of ripening the rate of respiration reaches a peak and then decline. This
peak is referred as “Climteric”.
Eg: Banana, Mango.
‘Avocado’ ripen only after harvest and also ‘Panchavarnam’ Mango veriety.

Sustainable Agriculture
Kerala is positioned at the intersection of different climatic and geomorphologic
features. The topography and physical characteristics change distinctly from east to
west, starting with the hills to the east, sloping down to the coast, which is covered by
coconut groves. Kerala has rich biodiversity and the Kerala stretch of the Western
Ghats is one of the world’s 34 biodiversity hotspots.
Kerala agriculture is distinct from that of rest of India in terms of resource
endowments, land-use and cropping pattern, scale of farming as well as socioeconomic
factors. Geographically, the state has a vast coastal line (low lands, 10 %), midlands
(42 %) and high lands (48%). The state receives high rainfall (2500 – 3000 mm), yet
faces acute shortage of water in summer. The relative humidity favours cultivation of
most of the tropical and subtropical crops but at the same time harbors all major pests
and diseases. The diversity in soil, climate and socio-economic endowments in the
state favours cultivation of a variety of crops, contributing to a rich and varied crop
cafeteria spread across its length and breadth. Another specialty of Kerala is
abundance of home gardens estimated at around 64 lakh numbers, presenting a
combination of crops, livestock, poultry/duckery and aquaculture.
Notwithstanding the above, the growth rate in agriculture is continuously negative for
the past many years, owing to a complex array of factors. As per the estimates of the
State Planning Board, the present growth rate of agriculture is about –2% leading to
continuous increase of non-farmed area. The share of agriculture and allied sectors in
GDP decreased from 35 percent in 1980, to about 14 percent in 2016. On one hand,
this shows that the economy is growing but more importantly, it reveals that the
growth is not balanced. Such a situation can be arrested only if production and
productivity is substantially increased and gross expenditure in production
substantially reduced, leading to increased net income.
The Task Force on Agriculture development has been constituted by the Kerala State
Planning Board by order dated 5th May 2015. The Task Force Report was prepared
after detailed discussion of subsector wise key issues, processing of 12th Five Year Plan
document, working group reports prepared for 12th Plan, sectoral papers, agricultural
development policy, study reports, Perspective Plan 2030, analysis of secondary data
and inputs from the departments. The agricultural development policy for the Sate was
approved in 2015.
In order to secure a sustainable path for a prosperous agriculture sector of the State
the Perspective Plan 2030 prepared by the State Planning Board, projects a minimum
average growth rate of 2 percent per annum. The focus is on increasing competiveness
and productivity in agriculture so as to raise incomes and wellbeing of farmers and
bring prosperity, not only for this generation, but for future generation too. The Plan
envisages:

Targets
 The average agricultural growth rate will be a minimum of 2 per cent per
annum.
 Improved farming efficiency will be achieved despite the expected drop in
agricultural area.
 The expenditure allocation towards agricultural research and education to
be raised to 1−2 per cent of GSDP of agriculture by 2030.
Mission
 Foster global competitiveness, growth and profitability in the sector in order
to attract new investment.
 Build lasting partnerships between public, private and other community
stakeholders.
 Increase creation of wealth in agriculture and rural areas.
 Improve investor confidence leading to increased investment in agricultural
activities and rural areas.
 Promote sustainable use of agricultural resources.
The focus is on increasing competitiveness and productivity in agriculture so as to raise
incomes and well-being of stakeholders and bring prosperity, not only for this
generation, but for future generations too.
Strategic framework
The strategic framework encompasses plantation and non-plantation crops. The
strategic framework will have three main pillars:
(i) Agricultural prosperity
(ii) Social inclusiveness: Food security, livelihood, rural area development
(iii) Natural resource conservation
The strategic framework for Kerala Agriculture is developed to promote green
economy based on agro-ecology principles that results in improved human well being
and social equity while significantly reducing environmental risks and promoting
environmental services. The strategic framework is suggested under four pillars with
identified focus areas under each pillar.
The strategic pillars and the focus area under each pillar are shown below:
1. Pillar 1 : Raise Agriculture productivity
 Closing the yield gap
 Improved Soil Health Management
 Improved Plant Health Management
 Promote new technologies
 Develop Technology Infrastructure
 Promote innovation

2. Pillar 2: Raise investment in Support Infrastructure
 Soil and water conservation
 Minor irrigation
 Input production infrastructure
 Laboratory net works
 Market/storage/post-harvest
3. Pillar 3 : Strengthening livelihood and assured income
 Revival of the perennial Tree crop systems
 Promote homesteads and Integrated Farming Systems
 Food and Nutrition Security 59
 Mechanisation
 Climate smart agriculture
 Support for low cost credit
 Promote value added agriculture
 Risk management
 Urban agriculture
 Expand social safety nets
4. Pillar 4 : Improve Service delivery
 Prominent and mainstreamed extension system
 Expand Agroservice centres
 Promote social capital development
 HRD and continuing Agriculture education
 Leveraging ICT application.
Some of the existing agricultural policies and programmes targeting to increase
agricultural production in Kerala are very relevant in context of climate change.
Watershed management programme, soil and water conservation initiatives, rain
water harvesting, input availability and efficiency, promoting organic farming and
insurance schemes are particularly relevant. Some of the key programmes in the
agriculture sector in the states relevant in the context of climate change are given
below:
 The Kerala Conversion of Paddy Land and Wetland Bill, 2007: This
bill is intended to conserve the paddy land and wetland and to restrict the
conversion or reclamation thereof in Kerala.
 Insurance Schemes: A significant contribution made as the part of rice
farmer’s welfare is the commencement of Kisansree, a programme for
providing insurance cover to five lakh farmers in the state
 Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY): As per the scheme, the
Government of Kerala has to prepare the State and District-level plans in the
field of agriculture based on agro-climatic conditions, availability of technology
and natural resources.

 Training Institute: Kerala has started an agricultural training institute and
identified as a very important input to strengthen the micro level agricultural
activities to make it more farmer-friendly and profit oriented.
 Formation of Debt relief Commission: Formation of Debt Relief
Commission was much lauded as the state had no model in the country to
emulate.
 Organic farming: Kerala has a remarkable share in the organic agriculture.
The Department of Agriculture, the State Horticulture Mission (SHM) and the
VFPCK are the major agencies supporting the organic farming directly in the
state apart from NGOs.
 Collective farming through Kumdumbashree : Harithashree the lease
land farming promoted by the State Poverty Eradication Mission, Kerala,
through Kudumbashree, has helped women farmers to stay on in agriculture
for their livelihood. The major crops cultivated by the Kudumbashree group is
paddy (27 % of area) followed by plantation and vegetables under the lease land
farming
Kerala State Organic Farming Policy, Strategy and Action Plan
There is a rich potential for promoting organic farming in Kerala in the light of the fact
that intensity of inorganic agriculture here is not that severe compared to that in other
States in the country. While the national average consumption of fertilizers and
pesticides during 2002-2003 was 90kg/ha and 288g/ha respectively, it was only
60kg/ha and 224g/ha respectively in Kerala. This points to the positive side of
agriculture in Kerala in terms of the already low levels of consumption of hazardous
chemicals and, therefore, chances of redeeming farmers to organic agriculture are
quite high.
The State Department of Agriculture commenced organic farming promotional
activities since 2002-03. In the following year, the Department set up a cell for
Promotion of Sustainable Agriculture and Organic Farming. It has also launched two
brands, namely ‘Kerala Organic’ and ‘Kerala Naturals’ to market organic farm
produces. Currently, about 7,000 farmers practice organic farming in the State as per
NPOP standards, covering a total area of 5750 ha.
Organic Farming Policy, Strategy and Action Plan Vision
Make Kerala’s farming sustainable, rewarding, and competitive, ensuring poison-free
water, soil and food to every citizen.
Objectives
1. Make farming sustainable, remunerative and respectable.
2. Enhance natural soil fertility and productivity.
3. Ensure soil and water conservation.
4. Ensure agricultural bio-security and food and nutritional security.
5. Create and ensure domestic market for organic products controlled by the
farmers.

6. Avoid the use of agrochemicals and other hazardous material and, ensure
chemical free water, soil, air and food.
7. Ensure seed, food and sovereignty.
8. Promote biodiversity based ecological farming.
9. Ensure quality control in organic inputs and agricultural produce
10. Enable human health promotion by providing safe agricultural products and
commodities
11. Conservation and extension of traditional knowledge related to agriculture.
Strategies and Action Plan
The mission to convert Kerala into an organic State is to be achieved focusing on
potential crops and areas in a phased and compact manner with the aim of converting
a minimum of 10% of the cultivable land into entirely organic every year and thus
achieving the target within five to ten years. On completion of the third year of
implementation of the organic farming policy, a Committee of experts comprising
representatives of farmers and scientists should make a comprehensive assessment of
the farmer’s wellbeing, economy and environment and, only after rectifying the
drawbacks, if any, can the policy be implemented in rest of the areas.
The strategies
1. Ensure seed sovereignty of the farmers and the State
2. Implementation of organic farming policy in a phased manner
3. Compact Area Group approach in organic farming
4. Strengthen soil and ensure water conservation measures
5. Promote a mixed farming approach for livelihood security and ecological
sustainability
6. Conserve and improve agro-biodiversity and undomesticated biodiversity
7. Launch a state-wide intensive campaign on organic farming in the form of a
popular movement: "Jaiva Keralam"
8. Ensure availability of quality organic manure to the farmers
9. Ensure farm inputs for organic farming
10. Capacity Building for farmers, implementing officers, agencies, and local
self-government members
11. Develop Model Sustainable Organic Farms in the State
12. Ensure and improve the health and wellbeing of the tribal through special
tribal agriculture programmes.
13. Establish Producer Companies promoted by organic farmers
14. Establish storage and transportation facilities
15. Promote farm level processing, value addition and encourage the use of
organic farm produce in food industry
16. Develop diverse channels for marketing of organic produce
17. Develop a simple certification process in the State for all organic farmers
18. Provide financial incentives for promoting organic farming
19. Encourage the use of renewable energy sources
20. Introduce organic farming in education institutions

21. Reorient Research, Education and Extension
22. Phase out Chemical Pesticides and Fertilizers from the farming sector
23. Integrate the programmes and activities of various departments, local selfgovernments and organizations
24. Organisational set-up for promotion of organic farming
Agriculture will be prosperous, if it is socially inclusive and environmentally friendly.
In coming years, there will be a paradigm shift from subsistence farming to highly
knowledge- intensive, competitive farming. Institutions and Innovations for
Sustainable Agricultural Growth, argues the need for a paradigm shift from
subsistence farming to knowledge-intensive, competitive farming. The focus will be on
increasing competitiveness and productivity in agriculture in order to raise the
incomes and well-being of stakeholders and bring long-term prosperity. Land zoning
is key to this sector, with paddy fields being protected as they are mostly low-lying
wetlands. Other measures include forming producer companies, adopting the latest
technology and implementing integrated farming techniques.
Sustainable agriculture - Some Promising Technologies / Farming
Practices in Kerala
Rice-based Integrated Farming System
Rice fields in the coastal Kerala are typical wetland eco-system with numerous
ecological and economic functions. High rainfall coupled with undulating topography
of Kerala generates different moisture regimes for crop growth resulting in a wide
range of micro-environments. Given the combination of season, and topography, rice
in Kerala is grown under a variety of agronomic conditions ranging from totally dry to
floating rice under rising flood conditions, from rainfed to irrigated conditions, sandy
to clayey soils and saline to acidic soils. Crop diversification has immense potential in
rice-based ecosystems. The studies conducted at Cropping Systems Research Centre,
Karamana revealed that raising green manure (dhaincha), bhindi or short duration
cassava in paddy fields during summer not only enhanced the profitability and
employment but also resulted in a shift of the obnoxious weed flora Echinochloa
crusgalli. In rice-based diversified cropping systems, one crop of rice followed by two
crops of Nendran banana offers high income potential. In such a system, over 10 t/ha
crop residues are available for nutrient recycling.
Homestead-based Integrated Farming System (IFS)
Homestead-based integrated farming system (IFS) is one of the most suitable farming
systems in Kerala which helps farmers to increase productivity and income in a
sustainable manner. Homestead farming satisfies the requirements of sustainability
by being productive, ecologically sound, stable, economically viable, and socially
acceptable. The productive aspect of homestead farming arises from the fact that home
gardens are resource islands that provide a wide variety of goods for domestic
consumption, such as food, beverages, construction materials, firewood, and other
household supplies. The system has the capacity to sustain crop or pasture production

in the presence of trees, in addition to production from the trees themselves. The
different crop or tree species in the home garden satisfy the multifarious needs of the
farmer. The produce from trees often provides a substantial proportion of the energy
and nutritive requirements of the household’s diet. A characteristic of food production
in home gardens is that the combination of crops with different production cycles
results in a continual supply of edible food. The livestock component, besides
providing financial support at times of distress, supports the farmer by providing
draught power, milk, meat, and organic manure.
Banana-based Cropping System
An integrated approach in banana farming is a successful intervention demonstrated
by KVK, Kozhikode with the objective of enhancing the income of farmers. This
technique showed an increase in the yield to the fold of 37 per cent in Kozhikode
district of Kerala. Foliar and soil application of a nutrient mixture was done to enhance
the production. Foliar application was done at the rate of 5g/l of water from 4 months
after planting till bunching at monthly intervals. While soil application with a
recommended dosage of 100g/plant was taken up at 2 months and 4 months after
planting. These nutrient mixtures for foliar and soil application are obtained from
ICAR-IIHR, Banglore and KAU, Thrissur respectively. Banana based integrated
farming approach was implemented in Naduvannur, Ulliyeri, Changaroth, Perambra,
Kavilumpara, Cheruvannur and Maruthonkara panchayats during 2012 to 2016. An
exclusive license to produce and sell the formulations from ICAR-IIHR, Bengaluru was
also obtained. Collaboration with ATMA for scaling up production technologies
boosted the prospect of this farming intervention. With a few interventions in the
traditional banana based cropping system, plants bunched by 5 ½ months after
planting while check plot bunching by 7 months only. Average bunch weight increased
to 14 kg from about 10 kg. Average yield in the demonstration plot was 20%higher with
11.6 kg fruits per plant compared to 9.7 kg in check. Bunches matured simultaneously;
uniform in size with bright yellow coloured fingers. All these helped the farmers to
reduce harvesting and transportation cost due to its even maturity. The economics of
banana cultivation also took an upturn with the productivity of Nendran banana in
Kozhikode district increasing from 4259 kg/ha of 2011-12 to 5427kg/ha in 2015-16,
almost an increase of 27 percent. Income increased from 2.4 lakh/ha to Rs 4 lakh/ha,
so is there standard of living.
Open Precision Farming in High-density Planting Banana
With a focus on increasing the area under banana and its productivity, KVK,
Ernakulam took the initiative to introduce open precision farming in banana. Open
precision farming is a type of high tech farming where the benefit of optimized farming
is extracted into the open fields. Generally, precision farming is carried out in poly
house cultivation but by bringing this into the open fields for cultivation of banana,
the farmers are made aware of the essentiality of applying optimum amount of
fertilizers and pesticide formulations. This will help in saving water and other inputs
and will result in an efficient farming practice. By the introduction of precision farming
technology in the fields of Ernakulam, average production per plant was seen to be 9.3

kg. Also the area under banana cultivation increased from 160 plants to 380 plants per
25 cents. Total yield increased by 116 per cent.
Rice-Fish-Duck-Buffalo Integration in Submerged Wetlands
Integrated farming involving poultry and aquaculture has great relevance to the
coastal rice lands such as Kuttanad, Kole and Pokkali/Kaippad. The coastal saline
soils along the Ernakulam district are referred to as pokkali fields, whereas in the
Alappuzha and Kannur districts they are known as Karilands and Kaipad, respectively.
The traditional paddy cultivation involving a salt- resistant and tall pokkali variety of
paddy, which is practiced during the rainy season from May-June to SeptemberOctober is followed by shrimp filtration from November to April, in the saline phase.
Shrimp filtration is essentially a trapping cum holding system in which water is let into
the field through sluice gate during high tide, but when the level reaches the same as
outside, the gate is closed trapping valuable fish and shrimp. There are many
advantages to this system of integrating traditional farming of paddy and fish/shrimp
together. The paddy field provides room for naturally available fish or shrimp juveniles
to grow and attain marketable size, providing natural feed for fishes and shrimps while
the animal excreta provide nutrients for the ensuing paddy crop. Such a system will
not only reverse the present trend of non-utilization and under-utilization of rice field
but also make rice farming more attractive, consequent to the increase in productivity
and profitability. As buffalo/poultry/duckery also forms an integrated constituent of
such a farming system, it can sustain food security. This system of farming could
trigger a process of change whereby the income and economic prosperity of people
living in these areas will increase leading to economic resurgence.
Vertical Farming for Urban/Peri-urban Households
Integrated intensive vertical farming is an innovative farming system concept which is
suitable for land-constrained terrains in the states of Kerala and north-east. A model
vertical farming unit developed by the KVK, Kannur and popularly known as „Giggin‟s
Farm Villa‟ is ideal for large scale adoption due to its high comprehensive design and
lucrative income prospects. The unit can be set up even on one cent of land. What
makes it attractive is its multifaceted nature, wherein farmers can rear goats, hens,
rabbits and quails, while also cultivating vegetables, gathering seeds, supplying
saplings and catering to production of organic manure.
The pyramidal structure of the farm makes it self-supporting. The farm is like an
apartment where animals are grown in different storeys. Adequate micro climate is
assured for animals and crops to have a sustainable production of eggs, meat, milk and
vegetables. All the components in the vertical farm are in harmony. Waste from one
component is used as input for other. The 26 efficiency of the farm depends on how
well the components are managed throughout the year. Estimates reveal that Rs.2
lakhs to Rs.2.5 lakhs may be earned a year and the farm will be earning profit by the
third year.

The pyramidal structure is further The pyramidal structure is further modified as
galleries where fodder and high-value crops of the farmer‟s choice may be grown.
Azolla grown on the side ramp provides nutritive feed for animals and poultry. An
overhead tank with micro irrigation coupled with recycling of animal urine collected
from the farm helps organic production of fodder and high value vegetables. The farm
produce may be marketed as organic or safe-to-eat products.
