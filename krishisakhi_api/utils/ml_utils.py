    You are an expert agricultural analyst for India. Based on the following farmer profile and real-time weather, generate a complete, structured dashboard report.

    **Farmer Profile:**
    - State: {profile.get('state', 'N/A')}
    - District: {profile.get('district', 'N/A')}
    - Primary Crop: {profile.get('primary_crop', 'N/A')}
    - Soil pH: {profile.get('soil_ph', 'N/A')}
    - Soil Nutrients (N,P,K in kg/ha): {profile.get('soil_N', 'N/A')}, {profile.get('soil_P', 'N/A')}, {profile.get('soil_K', 'N/A')}
    - Farming Experience: {profile.get('farming_experience_years', 'N/A')} years
    - Past Pest Issues: {profile.get('past_pest_disease_issues', 'None mentioned')}
    - Government Schemes Applied For: {profile.get('participation_in_govt_schemes', ['None'])}

    **Real-Time Weather Data:**
    - Temperature: {weather.get('temperature', 'N/A')}Â°C
    - Condition: {weather.get('weather', 'N/A')}
    - Humidity: {weather.get('humidity', 'N/A')}%

    **Your Tasks:**
    1.  **Crop Recommendation**: Recommend the single best crop for the next planting season.
    2.  **Yield Prediction**: Predict the yield in kg/acre for their current primary crop.
    3.  **Pest Risk**: Predict the pest risk as a percentage from 0 to 100.
    4.  **Quality Grading**: Estimate a "Quality Grading Score" from 0 to 100.
    5.  **Price Range**: Provide an estimated market price range (min and max) per quintal for their primary crop in their district.
    6.  **Scheme Analysis**: List relevant government schemes they are likely eligible for, and also list the ones they've already applied for from their profile.
